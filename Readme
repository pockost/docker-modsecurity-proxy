Supported tags and respective Dockerfile links
==============================================
1.15.2, latest ([1.15.2/Dockerfile](https://github.com/pockost/docker-modsecurity-proxy/blob/master/1.15.2/Dockerfile))


ModSecurity
===========

ModSecurity is a Web Application Firewall (WAF). There is two part :

* libModSecurity is the core of the project. This one can analyse web request and apply filter based on rule set.
* modsecurity plugins are the binding allowing webserver (Apache, Nginx, ...) to forward received request to libModSecurity.

For more information you can read <https://github.com/SpiderLabs/ModSecurity/tree/v3/master>.

Image building
==============

This image is based on pockost/modsecurity-nginx image and add the support of using nginx with modsecurity as a reverse proxy.

Available environment variable :
================================

* `PROXY_HOST` Host on which we want to forward request
* `PROXY_PORT` Port on which we want to forward request

You can also used all environment variable available in pockost/modsecurity-nginx.

Usage example
=============
`docker run --rm -it -e PROXY_HOST=myhost -v /path/to/rules/:/etc/modsecurity/rules/  pockost/modsecurity-proxy:latest`

If you plan to used OWASP rules you can used the pockost/modsecurity-crs to automaticaly download and update rules.

Here a docker-compose.yml example


```yaml
version: "3.0"

services:
  proxy:
    image: pockost/modsecurity-crs:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - ./owasp-crs/rules:/etc/modsecurity/rules
    depends_on:
      - crs-updater
    environment:
      - PROXY_HOST=php
  php:
    image: nginx:latest
  crs-updater:
    image: pockost/modsecurity-crs:latest
    volumes:
      - ./owasp-crs:/workdir
    environment:
      - CRS_BRANCH=origin/v3.0/master
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "test", "-d", "/workdir/.git"]
```
